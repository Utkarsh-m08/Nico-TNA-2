MOBILE APP FOR 
STREAMLINING TNA MANAGEMENT




This project encapsulates my efforts in creating a meaningful application that honors my elder sister’s (4th year) graduation project and  showcases my passion for coding and design.

BACKGROUND
The garment industry operates in a fast-paced and time-sensitive environment, where efficient time and action management is crucial. As this sector is growing, there is a constant need of advancement over the traditional methods, & hence it is very vital to create an easy-to-use platform to encounter the work load and reduce human errors. 
Development of a mobile application is an approach for maintaining the lead time through effective production tracking, for maintaining better communication and delivery analytics by craeting a common platform for communication between the organisation and vendor. 

OBJECTIVE
To increase the TNA Hit Rate & ease the exchange of information of TNA related activities majorly at Pre- Production stages

NEED OF THE PROJECT 
ERP/ MIS systems play a vital role in maintaining the database of the company- they have their own limitations regarding the accessibility outside the zone, limited approach, and vast database. 
This Application will not require a zone and can easily be opened anywhere else alongside the company. This app is developed to tackle the main issue of transparency and easy accessibility to the executives.

The home page includes personal information, a dashboard, which shows alerts for every stage of the TNA events. It will directly fetch the data from the database to popup notifications on the screen for the events where the scheduled date is passed, or is on the current date. 
For example, the figure shows PP sample alerts, and To- do alerts. 
Similarly for every event the alerts will come up and reminders will be sent to the vendors. 
On swiping the left side of the dashboard, we can see the navigation bar, which consists of different buttons, upon clicking which can navigate to the respective pages.

This page shows the style status, along with the Style ID, and its Expected time for arrival. The user will also be able to give comments for approval/ disapproval for the same to the vendors, so the comments for each style are in one platform and are easy to fetch and work upon. 
In the same way vendor can also update that revised samples of PP/ Fit or revised strike and lab dipping event has been completed.
